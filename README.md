Download videos from YouTube/Twitch/Twitter and more (any platform that is supported by youtube-dl) right in the Windows Explorer, without installing any shady shareware apps!

I made this script for myself, since I reference other YouTube videos and memes a lot in my own content and needed an easy way to download videos in an editing-friedly format (DNxHR 25 FPS in my case). The script will also update youtube-dl automatically if a new version is detected.

### Supported formats:
* Audio: MP3, WAV
* Video: MP4 H.264, MOV DNxHR

### How to use it
1. [Download the ZIP archive of this repository](https://github.com/notthebee/ytdl-explorer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unpack the archive
3. Double-click on the ytdl.reg file and confirm adding the keys to the registry
4. Copy the video link, go to the folder where you want to download it
5. Right click on the empty space and choose your option
6. Voil√†!
